# 🚀 Building LLM's Twin
### 📖 *LLM Engineer's Handbook* by Paul Lusztin and Maxime Labonne

An in-depth project inspired by *"LLM Engineer's Handbook"*, focused on creating a practical and functional twin of **(whoever built this)** a Large Language Model. This endeavor delves into:

- 🧠 **Custom GPT Development**: Building an AI twin that can interactively assist with learning, summarize concepts, and provide actionable insights.
- 🛠️ **Fine-Tuning Expertise**: Applying advanced fine-tuning techniques to optimize LLM performance for specific tasks.
- 🔗 **LangChain Integrations**: Exploring cutting-edge frameworks like LangChain and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
- 🌐 **Scalable Deployment**: Experimenting with deployment strategies for high-performance and scalable AI solutions.

This project is a testament to my commitment to mastering LLMs and pushing the boundaries of AI applications.
